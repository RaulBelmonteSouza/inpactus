# inpactus
I started my career as a software developer doing some jobs designing and building some websites
for small companies from my birth city, SÃ£o Borja/RS - Brazil. Inpactus was a small Software House
company founded by me. The websites were developed as monoliths using PHP, SQL, MySql,
Codeigniter, and Laravel for the backend and HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap for the
frontend.
